Create an application that allows users to enter their weekly budget and track how much is left based on their purchases throughout the week. At a minimum, this should include:

● Displaying the user’s weekly budget which will be updated every time a new item is
added to the list of purchased items.

● Allow the user to choose between four categories for each purchase.

○ Entertainment
○ Food
○ Clothing
○ Bills

● Must indicate to the user how much money has been spent, which requires an
easy-to-understand layout.

● The user should be able to see how much money is being spent on each of the four
categories.

● If their budget is consumed within the week, they must be notified that they cannot
purchase additional items.
